SeH started an empty project on a sourceforge account.

Decentralized global resource advertisement and discovery. Similar non-interoperating web services fragment web activity. A decentralized resource advertisement and discovery system surpasses the functionality of any individual site.

during this period SeH didnt do much with this idea while SeH focused on some of the Fractal 3D GUI work which you can read about here:

SeH later went on to creating this original Netention repository.  SeH coined the word Netention.  It was also around this time that Dante and SeH, through a mutual friend, Marc Fawzi, were discussing the beginnings of these concepts.

...Then switched to github:

*   https://github.com/automenta/old-netention2 2010-02-13
*   https://github.com/automenta/netention-old1 2010-03-20
*   https://github.com/automenta/netentionweb 2010-09-25
*   https://github.com/automenta/netention3 2011-10-22
*   https://github.com/automenta/netentionjs 2012-07-07

SeH prototyped in Java for a few attempts (Swing desktop, then GWT), then ended up experimenting with HTML5 / Javascript / Node.JS - which currently seemed to bring the quickest development workflow result, and also most accessible to users via web-browser

Throughout 2013 we had significant contributions that directly affected the code. One is Jim Lee's brilliant mobile user-interface overhaul.  Another is Dan Roble's Zertify / Wikipedia ideas which we developed, with his help, to make the Wikitagger components (with the '+' next to each wikilink).  Coincidentally Zertify paralleled SeH's own thoughts, arrived at independently, about the curriculum / employment paradigm:

As a result of the Zertify / Curiosume integration SeH developed the Spacetime Tag Planning algorithm, which has applications beyond Netention's scope.
